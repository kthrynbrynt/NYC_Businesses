## Questions and Motivation {.build}

- Where should I start or exand a business?

- Where do businesses with a particular license tend to cluster?

- Does my neighborhood have a surplus of or need for a certain type of business?

- What kind of license does a particular business I know about have? What are some similar businesses?

## App Features {.build}

- Look up a known business to see what license(s) it has

- Get information on basic licensing requirements for a chosen license 

- Get geolocation data on businesses with licenses of a chosen type

- Get summarizing data on businesses with licenses of a user-chosen type for user-selected neighborhoods and zipcodes

- Compare above data for two licenses 





## Findings {.build}

- Newsstands and cabarets missing from my neighborhood

- Lots of storage happens in the Bronx - opportunity in Brooklyn?
 
- Commercial Lessors host Bingo Games & Games of Chance - opportunity in Manhattan?

- Tow Truck Companies greatly outnumber Booting Companies - opportunity to collaborate?
